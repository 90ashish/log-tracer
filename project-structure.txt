Explanation of Each Directory
1. cmd/

    This directory holds the entry points for your different services (Producer, Consumer, and Dashboard). Each service has its own subdirectory under cmd/ where the main.go file resides.
    Scalability: If you add more microservices, you can easily create new subdirectories under cmd/.

2. internal/

    Contains the core business logic and implementation details for each service. This is split into subdirectories for producer, consumer, and dashboard.
    config/: Manages configuration loading and parsing.
    pkg/: Shared utility packages like Kafka client code (kafka/) and logging utilities (logger/).
    Scalability: Keeping your business logic in internal/ ensures that it’s not exposed to other modules or applications.

3. api/

    Contains API definitions, such as gRPC .proto files or REST API documentation, for each service.
    Scalability: API contracts can be managed here, making it easier to evolve or add new APIs.

4. configs/

    Stores configuration files for each service (like config.yaml or .env files). These are separated per service, making it easier to manage different environments (development, staging, production).
    Scalability: Configurations are easily extendable and manageable.

5. build/

    Contains Dockerfiles and other build-related files for each service. Separating Dockerfiles allows for custom build processes per service.
    Scalability: Adding new services or altering the build process for existing ones is straightforward.

6. docker-compose.yml

    Manages the Docker containers for all services. You’ve already seen how this works.
    Scalability: Docker Compose can handle orchestration of multiple services, making it easy to scale.

7. Makefile

    Automates common tasks such as building, testing, and running services. It can also include Docker-related commands.
    Scalability: As the project grows, you can easily extend the Makefile to handle more tasks.

8. README.md

    Documentation for your project, including setup instructions, usage, and other relevant information.

Benefits of This Structure

    Modularity: Each service (Producer, Consumer, Dashboard) is logically separated, making it easier to manage, test, and deploy individually.
    Scalability: As your project grows, you can add new services or extend existing ones without a major overhaul of the structure.
    Maintainability: The separation of concerns ensures that each part of the application is focused and easier to maintain.
    Reusability: Shared packages (like logging and Kafka utilities) are placed in internal/pkg/, allowing for easy reuse across services.

This structure should give you a solid foundation to build, scale, and maintain your log-tracer project. Let me know if you need help implementing any specific part!
