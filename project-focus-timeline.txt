To complete your project efficiently and ensure robustness, you should follow a prioritized approach, 
starting with the core functionalities that can be tested incrementally. Here's how you can approach it:
1. Kafka Setup and Basic Connectivity:

    Focus: Set up the Kafka infrastructure and ensure basic connectivity.
    Tasks:
        Finalize the docker-compose.yml to spin up Kafka and Zookeeper.
        Create a simple Go client in internal/pkg/kafka/kafka.go to connect to Kafka.
    Testing:
        Run docker-compose up and check if Kafka and Zookeeper are running.
        Write a basic test in kafka.go to produce and consume a message, ensuring Kafka is working as expected.

2. Producer Service:

    Focus: Implement and test the Producer service to send logs/messages to Kafka.
    Tasks:
        Implement kafka_producer.go to handle producing messages to Kafka.
        Implement handler.go to manage log/message creation and sending.
        Set up basic configuration loading in config/config.go.
    Testing:
        Start the producer service and use a test client or logs to verify that messages are being sent to Kafka.
        Verify message delivery by consuming it with a simple Kafka CLI command or a basic consumer in the same file.

3. Consumer Service:

    Focus: Implement and test the Consumer service to consume and process messages from Kafka.
    Tasks:
        Implement kafka_consumer.go to handle consuming messages from Kafka.
        Implement handler.go to process and possibly filter the messages.
        Configure the consumer in config/config.go.
    Testing:
        Start the consumer service and verify that it consumes the messages produced by the producer.
        Log or print the consumed messages to verify correct processing.

4. Dashboard Service:

    Focus: Implement and test the Dashboard service for real-time log viewing.
    Tasks:
        Implement webserver.go to handle HTTP requests and serve the dashboard.
        Implement handler.go to interface with the consumer or directly with Kafka to display real-time logs.
        Design a basic index.html template for displaying logs.
    Testing:
        Start the dashboard service and access it via a web browser.
        Produce messages using the producer and verify that they appear on the dashboard in real-time.

5. Integration Testing:

    Focus: Ensure all services work together seamlessly.
    Tasks:
        Start all services (Producer, Consumer, Dashboard) together using Docker Compose.
        Produce logs from the Producer, process them with the Consumer, and display them on the Dashboard.
    Testing:
        Monitor logs and ensure that each component works as expected.
        Test edge cases such as Kafka downtimes, message spikes, or incorrect message formats.

6. Dockerization and Deployment:

    Focus: Containerize each service and ensure they can be deployed easily.
    Tasks:
        Finalize Dockerfile for each service.
        Add relevant commands to the Makefile for building, testing, and deploying.
    Testing:
        Use docker-compose up --build to ensure that all services are containerized correctly and can be started together.
        Deploy to a local or remote Docker environment and verify everything works as intended.

7. Documentation and Cleanup:

    Focus: Document your project for ease of use and future reference.
    Tasks:
        Complete the README.md with setup instructions, usage, and any known issues.
        Ensure all configuration files in configs/ are well-documented.
        Clean up the codebase, removing any unnecessary files or code.

Suggested Order of Work:

    Kafka Setup (Docker Compose, Kafka Connectivity)
    Producer Implementation and Testing
    Consumer Implementation and Testing
    Dashboard Implementation and Testing
    Integration Testing
    Dockerization and Deployment
    Documentation and Cleanup

By following this approach, you'll be able to build and test your project incrementally, 
ensuring each component works as expected before moving on to the next. This will help you build a 
robust system within your 2-day timeframe.
