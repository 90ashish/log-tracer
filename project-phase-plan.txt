To create a robust Real-Time Log Monitoring System, we'll break down the tasks into several phases, 
focusing on the key components: data collection, processing, storage, and visualization. 
Here's a step-by-step plan to build the system:
Phase 1: Data Collection (Producers)

    1. Enhanced Logging in Producers

    Contextual Information in Logs:
        Service Name: Each log message should include the name of the service generating the log.
        Environment: Include environment information (e.g., development, staging, production).
        Severity Level: Add severity levels such as INFO, WARN, ERROR, and DEBUG.

    Structured Logging (JSON Format):
        Use a structured logging format like JSON for all log messages. This makes logs easier to 
        parse and analyze in downstream systems.
        Update the serializer.go file to ensure that all log messages are serialized into a structured 
        JSON format with the added contextual fields.

    Implementation Steps:
        Update the log handling logic in the handler.go file within the producer directory to include the 
        additional contextual information.
        Modify the SerializeToJson function to format the logs as structured JSON, including the new fields.
        Ensure that the logging mechanism can easily add or remove contextual fields by making the serializer 
        function flexible.

    2. Support for Multiple Log Sources

        Dynamic Configuration of Log Sources:
            Modify the config.yaml file to support multiple log sources. This can be done by allowing the sources 
            key to accept a list of services or log sources.
            For each log source, specify details such as the source name, severity level, and any other relevant information.

        Implementation of Dynamic Log Source Handling:
            Update the config.go file to parse the new configuration structure that includes multiple sources.
            Modify the kafka_producer.go and handler.go files to dynamically handle logs from different sources.
            Implement a mechanism to reload the configuration at runtime without requiring a restart, allowing 
            the addition or removal of log sources dynamically.

        Implementation Steps:
            Update the config.go file to handle an array of log sources.
            Adjust the log sending logic in handler.go to loop through all configured log sources and send logs accordingly.
            Implement a configuration reloader that watches the config.yaml file for changes and updates the 
            running configuration dynamically.
            
    3. Implementing Secure Log Transmission : ## TODO : Not Implemented ##

        Add SSL/TLS support to ensure secure transmission of log data to Kafka:
            SSL/TLS configuration for secure transmission has not been addressed yet. 
            This would typically involve updating the Kafka producer configuration to include SSL settings and certificates.

        Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for producers:
            Authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer), 
            have not been implemented. This would require additional configuration in both the Kafka broker and the 
            producer settings.

Phase 2: Data Processing (Consumers)

    1. Log Filtering and Enrichment

        Log Filtering:

            Purpose: Discard unnecessary logs based on severity level or other criteria to reduce noise and save 
            storage/processing resources.
            Implementation Steps:
                Define Filtering Criteria:
                    Update your config.yaml to specify filtering rules. For example, include minimum severity levels 
                    that a log message must meet to be processed.
                    You can extend the configuration to allow filtering based on other criteria, such as log source, 
                    environment, or custom fields.
                Implement Filtering Logic:
                    Modify the handler.go file in the consumer directory to incorporate filtering logic.
                    Before processing a log message, check if it meets the filtering criteria defined in the configuration.
                    Discard or ignore logs that do not meet the criteria.

        Log Enrichment:

            Purpose: Add additional metadata to logs, such as geolocation, user information, or application context, 
            to provide more context for analysis.
            Implementation Steps:
                Define Enrichment Metadata:
                    Extend your configuration to include enrichment rules. For example, define which metadata should be 
                    added to logs.
                    You can fetch enrichment data from external sources (e.g., a database for user information).
                Implement Enrichment Logic:
                    Modify the handler.go file to add enrichment logic.
                    For each log message, attach the required metadata based on the enrichment rules.
                    Ensure that the enrichment process is efficient to avoid adding significant latency to log processing.

    2. Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms

        Error Handling:

            Purpose: Enhance the consumerâ€™s robustness by properly handling errors and ensuring that failed messages are 
            logged and monitored.
            Implementation Steps:
                Categorize Errors:
                    Identify common errors that can occur during log processing (e.g., network issues, message deserialization 
                    failures).
                    Categorize errors as transient (temporary) or fatal (requires intervention).
                Implement Error Handling Logic:
                    Modify handler.go to include error handling mechanisms.
                    For transient errors, implement retry logic with exponential backoff to handle temporary issues.
                    For fatal errors, log the error details and move on to the next message.
                    Ensure that errors are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

        Retry Mechanisms:

            Purpose: Ensure that transient errors are handled by retrying the processing of failed messages.
            Implementation Steps:
                Configure Retry Policies:
                    Add retry configuration to config.yaml, specifying the maximum number of retries and backoff intervals.
                Implement Retry Logic:
                    Update handler.go to retry processing of failed messages based on the configured retry policy.
                    Use a backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the system with immediate retries.

    3. Scalability and Load Balancing

        Scalability:

            Purpose: Ensure that the system can handle increasing volumes of log data by scaling the number of consumer instances.
            Implementation Steps:
                Use Kafka Consumer Groups:
                    Modify your consumer configuration to use Kafka consumer groups. This allows multiple consumer 
                    instances to share the load of processing messages from the same topic.
                Scale Consumer Instances:
                    In your docker-compose.yaml, allow the consumer service to be scaled. For example, 
                    docker-compose up --scale consumer=3 would start three instances of the consumer service.
                    Ensure that each consumer instance is part of the same consumer group to distribute the workload evenly.

        Load Balancing:

            Purpose: Distribute the log processing load evenly among multiple consumer instances to improve performance 
            and reliability.
            Implementation Steps:
                Consumer Group Management:
                    Kafka automatically handles load balancing within a consumer group. Ensure that your consumer 
                    instances are correctly configured to be part of the same group.
                Monitor and Adjust:
                    Monitor the performance and load distribution among consumer instances. Use Kafka metrics to assess 
                    if the load is balanced.
                    Adjust the number of consumer instances as needed to maintain optimal performance.

Phase 3: Data Storage and Archiving

    Log Storage Backend:
        Integrate with a storage solution (e.g., Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL) to store and index logs for querying.
        Implement time-based log rotation and archiving to manage storage costs.

    Data Retention Policies:
        Implement configurable data retention policies to automatically delete or archive old logs.
        Ensure compliance with regulations or organizational policies on log retention.

Phase 4: Visualization and Monitoring (Dashboard)

    Real-Time Dashboard:
        Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize real-time logs, using technologies like WebSockets for live updates.
        Implement search and filtering capabilities to allow users to find specific logs.

    Alerting and Notifications:
        Integrate with alerting tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to send notifications based on specific log 
        patterns or thresholds.
        Implement support for various notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

    User Authentication and Role-Based Access:
        Add user authentication to the dashboard to control access to log data.
        Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain logs or features.

Phase 5: Performance and Reliability

    Monitoring and Metrics:
        Implement monitoring of Kafka, producers, consumers, and the dashboard to track performance metrics 
        (e.g., message throughput, latency).
        Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) to visualize metrics and set up alerts for performance issues.

    Testing and Validation:
        Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high volumes of log data.
        Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.

    Disaster Recovery and Backup:
        Implement backup mechanisms for critical data, such as configuration files and log archives.
        Plan and test disaster recovery procedures to minimize downtime in case of failures.

Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance

    CI/CD Pipeline:
        Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the system.
        Implement rolling updates and canary deployments to minimize downtime during updates.

    Documentation and Onboarding:
        Document the system architecture, configuration, and usage instructions for developers and operators.
        Provide onboarding materials and training for users of the system.

Implementation Strategy

    Start with Phase 1 and Phase 2, focusing on enhancing the producer and consumer functionality. Once these 
    are stable, move on to the dashboard and storage integration.
    Use Git branches to work on different phases or features in parallel, merging them into the main branch 
    once tested and stable.
    Iteratively test and deploy each phase to ensure the system remains functional and scalable as new features are added.

This plan should guide you through building a robust and scalable Real-Time Log Monitoring System step by step. 
Once each phase is complete, you can move on to the next, ensuring that the system is continuously 
improving and adapting to your needs.
