To create a robust Real-Time Log Monitoring System, we'll break down the tasks into several phases, 
focusing on the key components: data collection, processing, storage, and visualization. 
Here's a step-by-step plan to build the system:
Phase 1: Data Collection (Producers)

    1. Enhanced Logging in Producers

    Contextual Information in Logs:
        Service Name: Each log message should include the name of the service generating the log.
        Environment: Include environment information (e.g., development, staging, production).
        Severity Level: Add severity levels such as INFO, WARN, ERROR, and DEBUG.

    Structured Logging (JSON Format):
        Use a structured logging format like JSON for all log messages. This makes logs easier to 
        parse and analyze in downstream systems.
        Update the serializer.go file to ensure that all log messages are serialized into a structured 
        JSON format with the added contextual fields.

    Implementation Steps:
        Update the log handling logic in the handler.go file within the producer directory to include the 
        additional contextual information.
        Modify the SerializeToJson function to format the logs as structured JSON, including the new fields.
        Ensure that the logging mechanism can easily add or remove contextual fields by making the serializer 
        function flexible.

    2. Support for Multiple Log Sources

        Dynamic Configuration of Log Sources:
            Modify the config.yaml file to support multiple log sources. This can be done by allowing the sources 
            key to accept a list of services or log sources.
            For each log source, specify details such as the source name, severity level, and any other relevant information.

        Implementation of Dynamic Log Source Handling:
            Update the config.go file to parse the new configuration structure that includes multiple sources.
            Modify the kafka_producer.go and handler.go files to dynamically handle logs from different sources.
            Implement a mechanism to reload the configuration at runtime without requiring a restart, allowing 
            the addition or removal of log sources dynamically.

        Implementation Steps:
            Update the config.go file to handle an array of log sources.
            Adjust the log sending logic in handler.go to loop through all configured log sources and send logs accordingly.
            Implement a configuration reloader that watches the config.yaml file for changes and updates the 
            running configuration dynamically.
            
    3. Implementing Secure Log Transmission

        Add SSL/TLS support to ensure secure transmission of log data to Kafka:
            SSL/TLS configuration for secure transmission has not been addressed yet. 
            This would typically involve updating the Kafka producer configuration to include SSL settings and certificates.

        Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for producers:
            Authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer), 
            have not been implemented. This would require additional configuration in both the Kafka broker and the 
            producer settings.

Phase 2: Data Processing (Consumers)

    Log Filtering and Enrichment:
        Implement filtering logic to discard unnecessary logs based on severity level or other criteria.
        Add enrichment capabilities, such as adding metadata (e.g., geolocation, user information) to logs.

    Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms:
        Enhance the consumer with robust error handling, including retry mechanisms for transient errors.
        Log and monitor failed log messages for debugging purposes.

    Scalability and Load Balancing:
        Implement support for multiple consumer instances to balance the load and ensure high availability.
        Use Kafka consumer groups to automatically distribute the workload among consumers.

Phase 3: Data Storage and Archiving

    Log Storage Backend:
        Integrate with a storage solution (e.g., Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL) to store and index logs for querying.
        Implement time-based log rotation and archiving to manage storage costs.

    Data Retention Policies:
        Implement configurable data retention policies to automatically delete or archive old logs.
        Ensure compliance with regulations or organizational policies on log retention.

Phase 4: Visualization and Monitoring (Dashboard)

    Real-Time Dashboard:
        Develop a web-based dashboard to visualize real-time logs, using technologies like WebSockets for live updates.
        Implement search and filtering capabilities to allow users to find specific logs.

    Alerting and Notifications:
        Integrate with alerting tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to send notifications based on specific log 
        patterns or thresholds.
        Implement support for various notification channels (e.g., email, Slack).

    User Authentication and Role-Based Access:
        Add user authentication to the dashboard to control access to log data.
        Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain logs or features.

Phase 5: Performance and Reliability

    Monitoring and Metrics:
        Implement monitoring of Kafka, producers, consumers, and the dashboard to track performance metrics 
        (e.g., message throughput, latency).
        Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) to visualize metrics and set up alerts for performance issues.

    Testing and Validation:
        Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle high volumes of log data.
        Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure reliability.

    Disaster Recovery and Backup:
        Implement backup mechanisms for critical data, such as configuration files and log archives.
        Plan and test disaster recovery procedures to minimize downtime in case of failures.

Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance

    CI/CD Pipeline:
        Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the system.
        Implement rolling updates and canary deployments to minimize downtime during updates.

    Documentation and Onboarding:
        Document the system architecture, configuration, and usage instructions for developers and operators.
        Provide onboarding materials and training for users of the system.

Implementation Strategy

    Start with Phase 1 and Phase 2, focusing on enhancing the producer and consumer functionality. Once these 
    are stable, move on to the dashboard and storage integration.
    Use Git branches to work on different phases or features in parallel, merging them into the main branch 
    once tested and stable.
    Iteratively test and deploy each phase to ensure the system remains functional and scalable as new features are added.

This plan should guide you through building a robust and scalable Real-Time Log Monitoring System step by step. 
Once each phase is complete, you can move on to the next, ensuring that the system is continuously 
improving and adapting to your needs.
