# Real-Time Log Monitoring System

This project is a Real-Time Log Monitoring System built with Golang and Kafka. It consists of the following services:

- **Producer:** Simulates generating logs and sends them to Kafka.
- **Consumer:** Consumes logs from Kafka, processes them, and optionally sends alerts.
- **Dashboard:** Displays logs in real-time through a web interface.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Golang (for local development)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd real-time-log-monitoring


Log-Tracer is a robust and scalable microservice architecture designed for real-time log monitoring and analysis. The core functionality of Log-Tracer revolves around collecting, processing, and displaying real-time logs from various services and applications. This system is built using Golang and Kafka, ensuring high performance and reliability.
Key Features and Components:

    Enhanced Logging in Producers:
        Contextual Logging: Each log message includes essential metadata such as service name, environment (development, staging, production), and severity level (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG). This contextual information allows for more precise filtering and analysis of logs.
        Structured Logging: Logs are serialized into a structured JSON format, making them easier to parse and analyze in downstream systems. This approach enables the seamless integration of Log-Tracer with other logging and monitoring tools.

    Support for Multiple Log Sources:
        Dynamic Configuration: Log-Tracer supports multiple log sources, allowing it to handle logs from various services dynamically. The configuration is managed through a YAML file, which can be updated without restarting the service.
        Flexible Log Source Handling: The system can dynamically reload configurations, adding or removing log sources on the fly, which enhances its adaptability to changing environments.

    Data Processing (Consumers):
        Log Filtering and Enrichment: Log-Tracer implements filtering logic to discard unnecessary logs based on severity level or other criteria. Additionally, it can enrich logs with metadata such as geolocation or user information, providing deeper insights during log analysis.
        Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms: The consumer component includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure that transient errors do not cause data loss. Logs that fail to process are monitored and logged for debugging.
        Scalability and Load Balancing: Log-Tracer supports multiple consumer instances, balancing the load and ensuring high availability. Kafka consumer groups are utilized to distribute the workload automatically, making the system scalable and resilient.

Technical Stack:

    Programming Language: Golang
    Message Broker: Kafka
    Containerization: Docker
    Configuration Management: YAML
    Security: SSL/TLS (partially implemented for secure log transmission)
