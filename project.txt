Project: Real-Time Log Monitoring System
Description:

Build a system that collects, processes, and displays real-time logs from different services or applications. Kafka will be used to stream log data between producers (applications generating logs) and consumers (services that process or visualize logs).
Components:

    Log Producer Service:
        This could be a simple microservice written in Go that simulates generating logs.
        The service sends log messages to a Kafka topic.

    Kafka Broker:
        Kafka will act as the central message broker. Set up a Kafka cluster (can be a single node for simplicity) to manage log data streams.

    Log Processing Service:
        A Go service that consumes logs from the Kafka topic, processes them (e.g., filtering, aggregation), and potentially sends alerts if certain conditions are met (e.g., error rate threshold).

    Real-Time Dashboard:
        This could be a simple web interface to display logs in real-time. You could use WebSockets in Go to push log data to the frontend.
        Alternatively, send processed data to another Kafka topic and have a Go service consume it to feed the dashboard.

    Alerting Service (Optional):
        A simple service that consumes logs from Kafka and sends alerts (e.g., via email or a messaging app) based on certain criteria, such as error logs or high latency.

Key Kafka Concepts:

    Producers: The Log Producer Service will produce messages (logs) to Kafka.
    Consumers: The Log Processing Service and Dashboard will consume messages from Kafka.
    Topics: Use different topics for raw logs, processed logs, and alerts if needed.

Tools & Libraries:

    Sarama or Confluent-Kafka-Go for Kafka client libraries in Go.
    Gorilla WebSocket for real-time communication with the dashboard.
    Bootstrap Web UI for the front-end dashboard (if you choose to build one).

Timeline:

    Day 1:
        Set up Kafka and build the Log Producer Service.
        Build the Log Processing Service and get it to consume logs.
        Start working on the Real-Time Dashboard.

    Day 2:
        Finalize the Real-Time Dashboard.
        Implement the Alerting Service (if you choose to do so).
        Test the entire flow and handle edge cases (e.g., Kafka downtimes, log spikes).

This project should give you a solid hands-on experience with Kafka in a short amount of time, and it's scalable if you want to extend it in the future.
